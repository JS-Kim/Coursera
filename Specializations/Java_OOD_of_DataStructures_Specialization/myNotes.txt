Week3
* Points of Inheritance in OOP
1. Keep common behavior in one class
2. Split different behavior into separate classes
3. Keep all of the objects in a single data structure

* Compile Time Rules related to polymorphism
1. Compiler Only knows reference type
2. Can only look in reference type class for method
3. Outputs a method signature

* Runtime rules related to polymorphism
1. Follow exact runtime type of object to find method
2. Must match compile time method signature to appropriate method in actual object's class

* To resolve the compile error related to polymorphism
--> "Casting": widening or narrowing

* Narrow casting can cause "runtime error"
--> You should use Runtime type check using "instanceof" (i.e., checking is-a relationship)
